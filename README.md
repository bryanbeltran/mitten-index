# 🧤 Mitten Index

**Mitten Index** is a cold weather scoring system that tells you how *brutal* it really feels out there — not just what the thermometer says. Using real-time local data and Midwestern common sense, it gives you a score you can actually dress for.

## 🌡️ What It Measures

The Mitten Index blends hard data and human judgment, factoring in:

- **Temperature** (obviously)
- **Wind chill** (is your face gonna fall off?)
- **Humidity** (dry cold vs bone-deep chill)
- **Sunlight or cloud cover** (is the sun helping, or hiding?)
- **Recent weather shifts** (sudden 40° drops mess you up)
- **Perceived cold** (how Minnesotans *feel* it, not just measure it)

In short, is it “sweater weather” or “better cancel your plans”?

## 🧠 Why?

If you live where your eyelashes can freeze, you know the weather app doesn’t tell the whole story. A sunny 5°F might feel fine. A windy 25°F might feel like death. This tool helps you prep your layers, errands, and attitude accordingly — so you don’t get caught in a bad mood in a bad jacket.
